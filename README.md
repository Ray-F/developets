# Developets

Developets is a [DEVS â€“ Developers Society](https://www.facebook.com/devsuoa) 48 Hour Hackathon project.

_On Developets, dev teams can collectively own a virtual pet that's affected by the project quality based on your team's code quality. When a new person joins the team, they will learn its code standards quickly as the seniors will be sentimental about the team pet and help the junior not to kill it._

Developets won 1st place, a [Centrality.ai](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/centrality.ai_cennznet-nft-unhacktheworld-activity-6817584358178865152-N8pm/) special prize and was also awarded best technical implementation.
